kubernetesDistribution: Vanilla  #Vanilla for community kubernetes distribution else Openshift for Openshift

## In case of using these charts on Openshift then please use UBI images
## To know more about them follow this tutorial https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/cn5g/oai-cn5g-fed/-/tree/master/openshift

# oai-cu-up can be configured with multiple interface which may correspond to 3GPP logical interfaces. There can be one to one or one to many. 
# In case of one to one mapping e1,f1u,n3 all can have separate virtual interfaces. 
# In one to many mapping e1,f1u and n3 all can be mapped to one virtual interface. 
# Interface mapping is strictly based on your networking environment 
## Change these ip-addresses according to your environment
